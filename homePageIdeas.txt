For the home page in Fantasy FRC, we can add a system that takes the scores of every match from the Blue Alliance
and add a scroll wheel to navigate through all of the scores. This section could be called Recent Matches or something.

We can add a footer with all of our contact info and also have the About description of the use of this website.
